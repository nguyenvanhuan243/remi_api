## 1. Introduction
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Follow camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes.
- Avoid single-letter variable names except for simple iterators.
- Be consistent with naming across the project.

## 2. Prerequisites
- Use consistent indentation (preferably 4 spaces).
- Limit line length to 80 characters.
- Use clear and consistent formatting for code blocks.
- Use meaningful whitespace to improve readability.

## 3. Installation & Configuration
- Include a README.md file in each project repository with instructions on how to use the code.
- Document complex or non-obvious parts of the code with comments.
- Use Markdown for documenting code blocks, function signatures, and usage examples.
- Include information about dependencies, installation, and usage in the README.

## 4. Database Setup
- Write clear and concise comments.
- Explain the 'why' behind the code, not just the 'what'.
- Remove commented-out code before committing changes.
- Avoid unnecessary comments that simply restate the code.

## 5. Running the Application
- Implement robust error handling to handle unexpected situations gracefully.
- Use meaningful error messages to aid debugging and troubleshooting.
- Log errors appropriately for monitoring and debugging purposes.

## 6. (BE/FS) Docker Deployment
- Write unit tests for all significant pieces of functionality.
- Use a consistent testing framework.
- Ensure tests cover edge cases and error conditions.
- Automate testing as much as possible, including integration tests and continuous integration.

## 7. Usage
- Use Git for version control.
- Follow a branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow) to manage feature development and releases.
- Write clear commit messages that describe the changes made.
- Avoid committing large binary files or sensitive information.

## 8. Troubleshooting
- Follow language-specific best practices and idioms.
- Use design patterns and principles to write clean, maintainable code.
- Refactor code regularly to improve readability and maintainability.
- Keep dependencies up-to-date and minimize reliance on external libraries where possible.

## Conclusion
