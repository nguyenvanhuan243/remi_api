# What is Race Condition?
Race condition can be a problem in Ruby on Rails when multiple requests try to access and update the same database record at the same time. 

# How to prevent race condition
To prevent a race condition, developers can use database transactions or the lock! method to ensure that only one request can update the record at a time. It is crucial to weigh the performance impact of methods used to avoid a race condition.
